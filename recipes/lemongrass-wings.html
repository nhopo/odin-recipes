    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a homemade dish my mother created. In vietnamese cuisine, we like to cook with lemongrass. This dish is 
        fairly simple, but tastes good either with rice or as finger food!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken wings</li>
        <li>fresh chili</li>
        <li>fresh lemongrass</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>cooking oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chili and lemongrass into small rings</li>
        <li>Rinse the chicken</li>
        <li>If the chicken comes in a whole piece, cut it in the middle to seperate drums from stick</li>
        <li>Put the pieces into a bowl and season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Deep fry the chicken wings in hot oil. If you have an air fryer you can also use this instead</li>
        <li>As soon as the chicken is done and has a golden color, toss them in a pan together with lemongrass and chili</li>        
    </ol>
